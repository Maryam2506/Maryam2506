- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Maryam2506. Bachelor's in Computer Science
- ðŸ‘€ I have an interest in Front-End Development. I do some practical exercises on HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and jQUERY. My most commonly used JavaScript library is React JS.  
     My first priority as a front-end developer is to make a completely responsive design. Frame work for UI design i used are Bootstrap and Material UI.
