- 👋 Hi, I’m @Maryam2506. Bachelor's in computer science
- 👀 I have an interest in front-end development. I do some practical exercises on HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT. The library I used to build front-end designs is Reacter JS. 
     My first priority as a front-end developer is to make a completely responsive design. Another top priority is Client satisfaction.
