- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Maryam2506.
- ðŸ‘€ I have an interest in front-end development. I do some practical exercises on HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT. The library I used to build front-end designs is Reacter JS. 
     My first priority as a front-end developer is to make a completely responsive design. Another top priority is Client satisfaction.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning BS in Information Technology. I got a 3.60 CGPA in my previous semester.
